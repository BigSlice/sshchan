How to deploy sshchan safely:
===

1. Checkout sshchan from neetcode with git. Put the code into a suitable world-readable location.

$ git clone http://neetco.de/chibi/sshchan.git sshchan
$ mkdir [CODE DIR]
$ mv sshchan/* [CODE DIR]
 It's a good idea to keep your git directory and the running directory (where users will actually run the code from) separate.
 For [CODE DIR], I suggest something like /usr/local/share/sshchan.

2. Create a new group for the user account:

$ groupadd [GROUP NAME]
 e.g.
$ groupadd anons

3. Create a new user account in this group with a home directory where the chan is to be hosted:

$ useradd -d [HOME DIR] -m -g [GROUP NAME] -N -c 'sshchan user' [USER NAME]
 e.g.
$ useradd -d /srv/sshchan -m -g anons -N -c 'sshchan user' anonymous

4. Then, set the password.

$ passwd [USER NAME]

5. Add this line to the end of your /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

	Match User anonymous
	ForceCommand 'python3 /usr/local/share/sshchan/sshchan.py'

 Change the 'anonymous' to your chosen username; and the path to sshchan.py to where you stored it.
 Also make sure that your SSH server accepts password authentication (PasswordAuthentication yes)

6. Set up sshchan as the anonymous user:

$ su anonymous
$ cd /usr/local/share/sshchan
$ python3 setup.py

 The init script will ask you for the root directory of the chan. Type in the home directory of the anonymous user.

7. Make the first posts:

 It's a good idea to make the first post on every board you create, because otherwise it shows up with a 404 error because the 
 board index file is empty.

That's it!
